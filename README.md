# Western Health Machine-learning
Western Health Australia is a public hospital that serves a population of approximately 800,000 people in the western region of Melbourne.

The Victorian Government uses Weighted Inlier Equivalent Separation (WIES) value as their activity-based refunding policy for public hospitals. Each patient admitted to the hospital is assigned a WIES value which is determined by the classification of the patient into a Diagnosis Related Group (DRG). There are approximately 800 DRGs a patient can be classified to depending upon his/her illness and the treatment provided. At the end of the financial year, hospitals are then paid for their total WEIS activity.

The process of classifying a patient to a particular DRG is carried out manually by clinical coders which take around 20 days after the patient is discharged. The problem that this project attempts to solve revolves around this 20-day delay since Western Health is also required to provide an estimate of year-to-date WIES revenue to the Department of Health and Human Services in the first week of each month.

Outcome: Accelerating the monthly WIES estimation process would allow Western Health to reduce uncertainty and improve financial decision making
